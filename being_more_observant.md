## Example: Practicing Observation in Coding

When programming, being observant can help you spot bugs and improve your code quality. Here's a simple example in TypeScript:

```typescript:src/utils/observer.ts
export class Observer {
    private observers: Function[] = [];

    public subscribe(fn: Function) {
        this.observers.push(fn);
    }

    public notify(data: any) {
        this.observers.forEach(fn => fn(data));
    }
}
```

**Tips:**

- **Code Reviews:** Regularly review your code and others' to spot inconsistencies or improvements.
- **Logging:** Implement detailed logging to observe the behavior of your applications during runtime.

By integrating these practices into your daily routine, you can significantly enhance your observational skills, leading to better decision-making and increased awareness in various facets of life.
